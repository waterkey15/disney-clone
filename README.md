# Disney Plus Clone

This repository consists of frontend codes of Disney Plus clone Webpage. I started a firebase project and configured a database for 13 different movies. Frontend has capability of getting these movies' information from firebase database.

Frontend coded with using React.JS 

Database created with firebase database. I started my database in test-case which has 1 month of availability. If you want to demo it with the database let me know, I can deploy another project on firebase. 

Developers can deploy it locally for testing purposes with the following commands...


For Frontend 

```
git clone https://github.com/waterkey15/disney-clone.git
cd disney-clone
npm install
npm start
```
